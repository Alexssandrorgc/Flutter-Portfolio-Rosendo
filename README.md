# Rosendo's Flutter Development Portfolio

Hi there! üëã I'm Rosendo, a developer-in-training with a passion for building intuitive and functional mobile applications. This repository is a collection of projects I've developed during my **Integral Mobile Development** course, where I apply and demonstrate my growing knowledge of **Flutter** and **Dart**.

Feel free to connect with me on *pending*!

## üöÄ Featured Projects

Here is a breakdown of my work, organized chronologically. Each project represents a new challenge and a new set of skills acquired.

### [04 - Stateful Counter with History](./04-stateful-counter-history/)
An enhanced counter application that demonstrates more complex state management and conditional UI rendering.

* **Features**: History logging, dynamic list rendering with `ListView.builder`, a UI toggle to show/hide elements, and state clearing.
* **Skills Demonstrated**: **Complex State Management**, **Conditional UI Rendering**, `ListView.builder`, advanced list manipulation.

### [03 - Worker Management with Validation](./03-worker-management-app/)
An application that goes beyond simple data entry to implement business logic and form validation‚Äîa critical skill in real-world software development.

* **Features**: A registration form, field validation (unique IDs, non-empty fields, age requirements), and functionality to add/remove from a list of objects.
* **Skills Demonstrated**: **Form Validation**, **Business Logic Implementation**, state management with complex objects, `TextEditingController`.

### [02 - Student List with OOP](./02-student-list-oop/)
This project was my introduction to applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles within a Flutter application.

* **Features**: A `Person` base class and a `Student` subclass, a form to create new instances, and a dynamic list to display them.
* **Skills Demonstrated**: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Inheritance**, managing lists of objects, user input handling.

### [01 - Basic Flutter Counter](./01-flutter-counter-app/)
The starting point of my Flutter journey. This fundamental application was key to understanding widgets and basic state management.

* **Features**: Buttons to increment and decrement a numeric value on the screen.
* **Skills Demonstrated**: `StatefulWidget` vs. `StatelessWidget`, using `setState()`, basic Flutter app structure.
